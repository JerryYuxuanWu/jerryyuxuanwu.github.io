# Note
I really want to share the dashboard directly to you, but it seems impossible without a Microsoft Fabric with my school account, so excuse the screenshots.

# Introduction
In this project, I will explore the regional top-50 playlists on spotify by creating a data pipeline from extracting to loading to visualizing. The goal to is present a dashboard that updates weekly, synchronized with the playlist updates on spotify, and allow users to explore the different playlists around the world. In addition, I want to get experience with database and data visualization tools.

# Data Extraction
Data is extracted from the Spotify API using R, with the support of "spotifyr", a wrapper for the API designed for R. The IDs for the top-50 playlists around the world are stored in a csv, which the algorithm reads and fetched from the Spotify API. Then, the interested metrics are selected and extracted, such as valence, energy, duration, artist, etc. The extracted data are stored in a csv, which is then loaded into the database for storage.

# Data Storage
All playlist and track data are stored in postgresql server, using DBeaver as the database interface. This is then accessed by Power BI to load the data into Power BI

# Data Visualization
Data is directly loaded into Power BI from the postgresql server, which then undergoes additional manipulations to prepare the data for visualizations in Power BI.
