# Introduction
Airbnb, also known as Air, Bed, and Breakfast, is a type of home rental where homeowners rent out their homes to people looking for accommodation in the region, usually for a short period (Folger, 2021). Compared to other forms of residence, such as hotels, Airbnb is unique for its cozy feeling of being at home, which attracts tourists’ attention. Since the price of Airbnb is set directly by the homeowner, it is interesting to study the economics behind the Airbnb market. The research question for this project is, “how does the price of Airbnb associate with factors such as location, property type, the number of bathrooms, etc?" Specifically, we are interested in learning how and why homeowners set the prices and the roles that location and property features play. For instance, does being in the downtown area make the listing price higher? And if apartments are generally more expensive than houses.

Numerous existing works of literature have explored the economics behind Airbnb listing prices. Perez-Sanchez and his team utilized 2018 Airbnb listing data to closely explore the association between price and location, in “four Spanish Mediterranean Arc cities” (Perez-Sanchez et al., 2018). In general, they found results contrary to prior literature, such that price increases as distance to tourist areas increase. This is counter-intuitive as we expect tourists to favor listings close to tourist sites, leading to higher demand and higher prices. For example, in another paper by Gyodi and Nawaro, who examined the relationship between Airbnb price and location in 10 European cities, they found that while location and price are strongly correlated, prices increase when near popular tourist attractions (Gyudi and Nawaro, 2021). Gyudi and Nawaro also conclude that prices decrease as the listing is further from the city center. In both works of literature, accommodation characteristics such as the number of bathrooms and allowed accommodations are shown to have significant positive influences on listing price, concurring with prior literature. Both works of literature leveraged the OLS regressions as one of their statistical methods. In addition to OLS regression, Perez-Sanchez’s team also included the quantile regression method to overcome OLS regression’s limited generalizability issues. On the other hand, Gyodi and Nawaro utilized various spatial models to exclusively consider the relationships between spatial variables and how they affect Airbnb prices.

Building upon these two works, we will closely tackle the Airbnb data for Boston, MA, United States. This allows us to investigate the relationship between price and the distance to tourist areas or city center in the scope of Boston, and thus, make comparisons to other cities. Furthermore, we will dive deeper into the differences between the locations and consider how housing prices are different at baseline. Finally, we will use a combination of OLS regressions and regression trees to examine the relationship between these variables and make predictions based on the fitted models. Hence, this paper differentiates from existing literature by the studied area, which provides more insights into the generalizability of existing results and approaches the problem with Machine Learning techniques.

Throughout this paper, we will first introduce the data and explore the variables, including various summary statistics and maps to spot potential associations between price and the predictors. Then, based on the results of data exploration, we will investigate the baseline differences between different regions of Boston, which may help explain any trends we observe. Lastly, we will perform several mathematically rigorous methods to assess the association between our variables and verify our hypothesis in the earlier sections.
# Data
The data set utilized for this project is the Boston Airbnb Open Data, which can be found on Kaggle (Kaggle, 2019). As indicated in the data description, this data set is organized from Airbnb Inside, a website that collects Airbnb data from the Airbnb listing sites. This data exclusively includes the information of 3585 unique listings on the platform at the timestamp of September 7, 2016. Therefore, it means that the analysis is less applicable to the current context as the data is from 5 years ago, but we can still get a general sense of the relationship between price and other factors.

The dependent variable for this study is price, which indicates the rental price per night, in US dollars. The independent variables, which help to explain the variation in prices, include the number of beds/bedrooms/bathrooms/accommodates, and the neighborhood, property type, and room type. These will be discussed further in section 2.2.

Since we have missing values for some of the predictor (independent) variables, we will remove any listing with null values for these columns to keep our analysis consistent. After dropping the rows with NA values for the used variables, we are left with 3554 listings.
# Summary Statistics
Out of the 3554 listings, this is how price varies. Notice that the graph on the right only includes listings with prices less than $1000, which better visualizes the shape of our dependent variable. Generally, by excluding the outliers, the distribution of price is right-skewed, with an average of roughly $174. This brings us the interest of why some rentals are much more expensive than others.
![Figure1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=12mpwpu1idq20hDTtRdCWWmN_yfcs9961)
When we look at the four numerical predictors, we notice similar trends to the distribution of price, such that they are all right-skewed, and listings mostly have a low number of bathrooms/bedrooms/beds/accommodates. For example, the entire interquartile for bathrooms is 1 bathroom. This may explain why some listings have much higher prices, as they have more rooms or beds. Similarly, we also have outliers in these variables, for example, some listings have no bathroom and some listings have 16 beds. Generally, we do not observe any obvious correlations, such that there is no clear positive or negative relationship shown in these points. However, note that most of the data points are clustered at low values of X. This may hinder the graphical display and will require further computations to evaluate the actual relation.
![Figure2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1YyceVhPJFSiZ5OBCGTB3U-YX9fYTLzJD)
For the room type, including the entire home/apt, private room, or shared room, we closely look at the listings with a price lower or equal to $500 to exclude outliers. Then we observe that the room type of the entire home/apt is related to the higher price level. This is intuitive as the rentee does not need to share any common space like for private room or shared room, making the rental exclusive and providing the renter an incentive to put higher price tags.
![Figure3](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1Lnjp7a03jREoGpIC05rQPzzfy8fr1YeR)
We notice that there may be some association between property type and price. For example, by comparing the two dominant property types, house and apartment, the latter has a higher median and maximum, as well as higher outliers. This may infer that there is some association between property type and price. However, this graph also suffers due to different sample sizes and outliers, hindering the interpretability and requiring future computations.
![Figure4](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1WC2awjIUstNA25o9IyuO6zptKLgLsOaB)
As for location, which we are representing using neighborhood, the number of listings for each neighborhood highly varies. Such neighborhoods like Jamaica Plain have close to 350 total listings, compared to smaller neighborhoods like Leather district only has 5 listings. When we compare the listing prices between each neighborhood, we observe that in general, the neighborhoods closer to the downtown area are more expensive. This is where the darkest areas are in Figure 5. In addition, these maps support the claim that by being closer to the city center, the listings’ prices increase.
![Figure5](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=11oCRCLk5I_FSDEdpmvzP784p7ZRqPy8X)
However, this may be due to other factors such as the listings near city centers being larger, having more beds, or allowing more guests. Hence, we visualize this in Figure 6, which does not show significant differences between the other features.
![Figure6](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1jNftw-FR2S75bxIjq2mUyN1vjFdhRpUy)
To further understand the differences between the neighborhoods, we will also examine some demographic information using extra data from the American Community Survey in Figure 7. Through the population map, we notice that the neighborhoods farther away from the city center have more residents. However, since these neighborhoods are also larger, their population densities are lower. Population density is larger for neighborhoods closer to downtown, which is reasonable since there are more apartments and condominiums downtown.
![Figure7](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1sBA0CMgm1_zr2UL2NqlcUGiMV7k1J4wa)
When the consumer's willingness to pay increases, the owners are more likely to charge higher rental prices. Therefore, we also evaluate the per capita income of residents in each neighborhood. Once again, we observe that the neighborhoods closer to the city center have higher per capita income. This supports the economic theories related to the income effects and how higher income leads to higher price levels. By observing these demographic features, we notice that the neighborhoods are different at baseline, and these differences may be the reason why listing prices differ.

In Figure 7, the data is obtained from Analyze Boston, which is organized based on the American Community Survey from 2015 to 2019 (Analyze Boston, 2021). To compute the population density, I have used the population variable from the ACS data set, and the SqMiles variable from the boundary shapefile. Note that in the ACS, which is reported every 5-years, the precision of measurement does not enable us to isolate a few neighborhoods and get their statistics. Instead, Chinatown, Leather District, and Downtown are combined into Downtown. In addition, South End and Bay Village are combined into South End. Lastly, Harbor Islands are not measured. Therefore, the demographic data based on the ACS only consist of 22 neighborhoods instead of 26. To reflect this discrepancy, the boundary shapefiles are adjusted accordingly to represent the union in some cases.

Since the rental price can be affected by the property’s value, we have further explored the home prices of each neighborhood. For example, a neighborhood that is experiencing large increases in housing prices may indicate an increase in land value and development. Since property owners have the incentive to set the rent at a level that covers the cost, by exploring the house prices, we can potentially understand why the Airbnb listing prices are higher in some neighborhoods. The housing data utilized in this project come from the Single-Family Home Prices in Greater Boston 2017 article published by the Boston Magazine (Boston, 2017). The table on this website is provided by the Massachusetts Association of Realtors and MLS Property Information Network.
![Figure8](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1DxCKvM8v5mFfhsZvM3s3789dwV7EQQe4)
Unfortunately, we are lacking information on some of the downtown neighborhoods, which is the area of interest. Using the available data, we can identify a slight pattern of the increasing price closer to the downtown area. This would be expected as it can explain why the average listing price of Airbnb is higher for those neighborhoods, such that the property owners have an incentive to set the rental price at a higher level that matches the housing value.

By comparing the 5-year price change percentages, we notice that the neighborhoods that are experiencing the highest increases are the neighborhoods in the area between the more urbanized downtown and rural suburbs. This may infer that throughout these 5 years, the urban area is expanding out, and neighborhoods at the edge of the downtown area are influenced the most.

Finally, as shown in the previous graphs, we are lacking data about some of the neighborhoods because no sales were recorded or reported on the source website. Therefore, we would like to evaluate the pattern for the number of sales across the neighborhoods. Surprisingly, there seems to have a significant relationship between neighborhood and the number of sales recorded in 2016. Specifically, we observe that the neighborhoods further out in the rural area, such as West Roxbury and Roslindale, have much higher sale numbers than the neighborhoods in the downtown areas.

Economically, there are many explanations for this trend. For example, more people might be investing in properties in the rural areas expecting their values to increase in the long term as the city expands further. On the other hand, the downtown region might have low sales numbers as property owners are unwilling to sell their houses and convert properties into cash due to the existing high values. From the previous map, we notice that the neighborhoods that are experiencing larger appreciations are the ones slightly further away from the downtown area, which may explain why sales numbers for rural neighborhoods.

Up until this point, we have mostly been using maps to visualize how the Airbnb listings differ by neighborhood. We have found the downtown neighborhoods being more popular, with higher supply and price. In the next section, we leverage regressions and machine learning methods to conduct a more mathematical rigorous analysis of the relationships between the dependent variable, price, and the independent variables.

## OLS Regression Results
First, we attempted to fit four models with different sets of predictors. The full regression results are shown in the appendix. During the process, after we tried to include quadratic terms for our numerical variables to account for diminishing return, we realize that the quadratic terms do not improve the model significantly, shown between the adjusted R-squared of models 2 and 3. If we only include the quadratic terms for accommodates and bedrooms in the final model, the result will indicate that these quadratic terms are no longer significant, which means that there is no point in adding them, and there is no evidence of a diminishing return trend.

Model 4 is our preferred model because of its largest adjusted R-squared and the number of significant predictors. By including all the variables, it also generates a large picture of how the variables collaboratively explain the variable in prices. The result suggests that:

Constant: The constant term represents the predicted price for a shared room apartment listing at Mattapan, with 0 beds, 0 bedrooms, 0 bathrooms, and allows 0 accommodates. As we can tell from the estimated value being -52.92, this is not interpretable.

- Neighborhood dummies: In general, when the listing price is compared to the neighborhood with the lowest average, Mattapan, 14 neighborhoods have statistically significant different average listing prices. This difference is largest for South Boston Waterfront, such that when holding other factors constant, listings in South Boston Waterfront are on average 164 dollars more expensive than listings in Mattapan. The difference is certainly practically significant. We also have 10 neighborhoods that do not have statistically significant different listing prices when compared to Mattapan.
- Beds: The coefficient means that when holding other factors constant, an additional bed will lead to an $8.96 increase in the listing price. This is statistically significant with a p-value less than 0.05, but not economically significant as it only leads to an increase of around 5% in average price.
- Accommodates: The coefficient means that when holding other factors constant, allowing an additional guest will lead to a $4.96 increase in the listing price. Similarly, this is statistically significant but not economically significant.
- Bathrooms: The coefficient means that when holding other factors constant, an additional bathroom will lead to a $25.79 increase in the listing price. This is statistically significant with a p-value less than 0.01, and also more economically significant than the above too numerical predictors, since it now leads to a roughly 26 dollar increase.
- Bedrooms: The coefficient means that when holding other factors constant, an additional bedroom will lead to a $45.25 increase in the listing price. This is both statistically significant and economically significant as the average price for all listings is $174.
- Property type dummies: As noted previously, we do not observe a significant difference between the listing prices of apartments and other types.
- Room type dummies: Lastly, we observe significant differences in the listing price between listings of entire properties and listings of shared rooms. Specifically, holding other factors constant, listings of the entire property are on average $68.71 more expensive than listings of shared rooms. However, there is no significant difference between private rooms and shared rooms.

Throughout the four models, we observe a huge increase in the adjusted R-squared when adding in the numerical predictors, meaning that it is both insufficient to only predict with neighborhoods,
and also significant to use the number of beds/bedrooms/bathrooms/accommodates in the model. By interpreting the R-squared for model 4, it means that 36% of the variation in listing prices is explained by the combination of neighborhood, the number of beds/bedrooms/bathrooms/accommodates, property type, and room type. When we account for the degrees of freedom, the adjusted R-squared drops to 0.34 to penalize the number of predictors used in the model.

In answer to the research question, we conclude by regression that the price of Airbnb listings in Boston is associated with the location of the listing, the number of beds/bedrooms/bathrooms/accommodates, and room type, but not associated with the type of property.

## Regression Tree (ML) Results
In general, regression tree algorithms find the cut-off conditions that minimize the estimation errors when splitting the observations into subgroups, also known as the objective function.
![Figure8](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1XNrPuTyk4F8SUGkeQSv5BfBCZ0fQr_5M)
The size of the tree is determined by the regularized parameters, including the maximum tree depth, pruning parameter, and minimum leaf size. This creates a tradeoff between interpretability and complexity, where a larger tree is more accurate but less generalizable and interpretable.

In this project, we first fit a regression tree with a maximum depth of 3, a pruning parameter of 0.1 and no leaf size restrictions, which makes the tree easier for us to interpret. We have included the same set of predictors as in model 4 of OLS regressions. We notice that the root of the tree is
separated based on room type, such that the right region is for all entire home/apartment listings and the left region for the private/shared room listings.

For the left region, we then separate the leaf based on if the listing is located in the downtown neighborhood. Note that this refers to the neighborhood named downtown, not the downtown neighborhoods. If the listing is in the downtown neighborhood, then it goes down right, and if not, it goes down left. By comparing the values in the two children of this leaf, we notice that for private or shared room listings located in the downtown neighborhood, the average price is $192, compared to the average of $94 for the ones, not in the downtown neighborhood. This coincides with our prior beliefs that listing price is influenced by the location, where downtown neighborhoods, including downtown itself, have higher prices on average.

For the right region, we then condition on the number of bathrooms, where for private or shared room listings with less than 1.25 bathrooms, the average price is $198.4, compared to the $316.8 when there are more than 1.25 bathrooms. This coincides with the regression result showing more bathrooms lead to higher prices.
![Figure9](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1c7w0mrwnDVlzumScV7KKOYtPYjSW0ePG)
We then compare this regression tree with our OLS linear regression result for model 4. We observe that with only a maximum depth of 3, a pruning parameter of 0.1, and no leaf size restrictions, the MSE of the regression tree, 15676, is larger than the linear regression result, 14444. But as we allow for more complexity by increasing depth, we get lower MSE for the regression trees. However, this comes with the consequence of more complex models that are harder to interpret, which we have discussed previously.

If we choose a tree with a similar MSE to our regression, it would be the one with a maximum depth of 5, a pruning parameter of 0.1, and no leaf size restrictions. Since the tree is too large to visualize, we will compare the estimations from the OLS regression with the regression tree for two examples:

- Neighborhood = "Downtown", Property type = "Apartment", Room type = "Private room", Beds = 2, Bedroom = 2, Bathroom = 1, Accommodates = 4
 - OLS regression: $220.15
 - Regression tree: $208.632
- Neighborhood = "Jamaican Plains", Property type = "Condomium", Room type = "Entire Home/Apt", Beds = 1, Bedroom = 1, Bathroom = 1, Accommodates = 2
 - OLS regression: $135.76
 - Regression tree: $196.83

Hence, we conclude that the estimations can be quite different when we estimate the listing price using the two different methods.

# Conclusion
In answer to the research question, “how are the prices of Airbnb listings affected by factors such as location, property type, etc,” we obtained data about Airbnb listings in Boston, as of September 7, 2016, after removing observations with missing values, yielded a total of 3554 unique listings. Throughout the entire paper, we identified the trend that listings become more expensive when their location is closer to the downtown region. This concurs with the literature by Gyodi and Nawaro but is contrary to Perez-Sanchez and his team’s results. The discrepancy further suggests that the relationship between an Airbnb’s price and its location can greatly differentiate across different cities. For baseline characteristics of the neighborhoods, we realize that the downtown neighborhoods also have higher population density, per capita income, and higher price levels. These external factors can all explain the higher rent prices, such that property owners have the incentive to charge higher prices to cover the cost. We also report that the number of beds/bedrooms/bathrooms/accommodates are all positively affecting the Airbnb listing price, such that increasing any of these leads to an increase in price. This concurs with the results of existing works of literature and further provides evidence for this relationship. Finally, listings for the entire property are
significantly more expensive than listings for a shared room, and the listing price is not affected by the property type, such as apartment/house/condo.

To understand why location affects the Airbnb listing price differently for different cities, research should be done on a broader scale. For example, perform analysis on Airbnb data across the globe, allowing the researchers to distinguish cities where people visit for working purposes and cities where people visit for tourism. If possible, gaining access to panel data would allow us to perform difference-in-differences analysis and net out time effects. Lastly, future work can be done to assess the assumptions of the OLS regressions, since violations in assumptions can lead to biases and incorrect results. More work can also be done to improve the machine learning algorithms by adjusting the regularized parameters while accounting for interpretability.
