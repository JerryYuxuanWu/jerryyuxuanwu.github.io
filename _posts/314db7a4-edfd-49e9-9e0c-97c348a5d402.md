# Abstract
In this research, results from regression analysis and hypothesis tests show statistical significance in the potential relationship, causal or descriptive, between Covid-19 death rate, GOP vote share, and full vaccination rate. The most well-fitted model suggests a positive correlation between death rate and GOP vote share and a generally negative correlation between death rate and full vaccination rate. A quadratic relationship is observed between death rate and full vaccination rate, showing a diminishing return of benefit from vaccination and supports the theory about the type of economic good of vaccine. However, there is an inability to fully meet least square assumptions. These limitations are motivations for future research.
# Introduction
In 2020, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic suddenly arrived. As the virus spreads in the U.S., causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and economic crisis, data shows that during the first wave of covid, blue (democratic) counties have suffered from higher mortality rate, unemployment rate, economic damage than red (republican) counties, followed by Donald Trump‚Äôs tweet taunting the ‚Äúincompetent democratic politicians in the blue counties‚Äù (The Economist). As the second wave of Covid-19 hit the U.S. on June 26, 2021, it is interested to re-examine the relationship between death rate and political orientation but using new data from the 2020 U.S. Presidential Elections.
In addition, as vaccines are in theory considered as an economic good that delivers externality benefit with diminishing returns, this study wishes to analyze the real-world application of this theory. The result can bring insight to future encounters with global viruses.
# The Context and Data
This study uses a cross-sectional dataset of 3000 randomly selected (with replacement) U.S. counties; compiled from multiple sources. Table 3 includes the descriptive statistics for the variables of the initial 3000 counties. Five counties with missing values for regressor variables (shown in Table 1) are removed to unify the set of counties used for the regression analysis.

Table 1 includes the mean and standard deviation of all the explanatory variables used in the regression, compared across five groups. For the death rate during the second wave, data shows that the red counties have a higher average of 37.41, and the blue counties have a lower average of 26.09. In addition, Figure 2 shows a seemingly positive relationship between death rate and GOP vote share, implying that a higher GOP vote share may potentially be accompanied by a higher death rate. Meanwhile, red counties have, on average, lower full vaccination rates than blue counties (34.25% to 46.92%), as Figure 4 shows that as GOP vote share increases, the full vaccination rate tends to decrease. Incorporating this with Figure 3, where a seemingly negative relationship is shown between death rate and full vaccination rate, it is plausible that the lower vaccination rates in red counties may be a factor that leads to higher death rates.
# Regression Analysis
## Simple Linear Regression
Firstly, a simple linear regression analysis is performed with the predictor (independent) variable
being the share of GOP vote of the county, where the dependent variable is death rate, deaths per 100,000 from COVID-19 in the second-wave in U.S. Result is in column 1 of Table 2.

The SLR estimates that there is one extra death per 100,000 people in the county for a 0.38% increase in the share of the GOP vote, coinciding with Figure 2. The regression R-squared (all adjusted) is 0.034, inferring that there is almost no fit and the variance of death rate is hardly explained with only the GOP vote share. The standard error of the regression means that for a death rate estimated at the specific GOP vote share, the actual observed death rates are on average off by 31.91, quite large considering that the standard deviation of the death rate is 32.46. However, it does not deny the potential causal effect that GOP vote share has on death rate.

To explore this, a hypothesis test will be used, set up as: ùêª0: Œ≤ùëñ=0 ùë£ùë†. ùêªùê¥: Œ≤ùëñ‚â†0 at 5% significance level. Where ùëñ is a placeholder for the coefficient being tested on. In this case, ùëñ=1.
The goal of the hypothesis test is to collect evidence against the null hypothesis (ùêª0), with respect to the alternative hypothesis (ùêªùê¥). In this case, the null hypothesis suggests that the true coefficient parameter Œ≤1 is zero, and a change in the regressor will not affect the death rate. Meanwhile, the alternative hypothesis suggests there is a causal effect. To perform the hypothesis test, assume that the SLR assumptions 1-4 hold, and a sample size of 2995 to be sufficient for CLT.

The method of this and further hypothesis tests is to construct at-statistic by ùë°=(Œ≤ùëñÃÇ‚àíŒ≤ùëñ,0)/ùëÜùê∏(Œ≤ùëñÃÇ). Results are calculated using data in Table 2 and are shown in Table 4 for all four regression specifications. At a 5% significance level, it is statistically significant if |ùë°|>1.96, and reject the null hypothesis.

For this specification, ùë°=(0.38‚àí0)/0.036=10.56>1.96, so it is statistically significant and there is enough evidence to reject the claim that the GOP vote share does not affect the death rate.
Now, one will review the SLR assumptions to examine any potential biasedness in the estimated coefficients. For SLR1, by looking at Figure 2, the relationship between death rate (dependent variable) and GOP vote share (independent variable) is not clearly linear, but rather slightly upward curving like a parabolic shape. The potential violation of this assumption may lead to bias in the estimation of coefficients. For SLR2, since the data is collected through simple random sampling with replacement, observations are I.I.D and the assumption of randomness holds. For SLR3, as shown in Figure 2 and summary statistics, many distinct shares of GOP votes are
observed. For SLR4, zero conditional mean, based on the potential violation of SLR1, if a linear model is fitted to a quadratic relationship, then at certain values the observations will ‚Äúcurve‚Äù away from the linear line, which implies a non-zero error term. For SLR5, homoskedasticity, if a linear line is fitted onto Figure 2, the variances of observed values are clearly different across GOP vote share, implying heteroskedasticity. In general, only the second and third assumptions seem to hold.

## Multiple Linear Regression
For the SLR model, it is both poorly fit and satisfy very few assumptions. A possible explanation for this issue is the existence of omitted variable bias, where variables that are correlated with the regressors (such as VoteGOP), are left out in the regression model (kept as error term). For example, in Figure 3, there is a potential negative correlation between GOP vote share and full vaccination rate, but the SLR model did not consider full vax rate. Hence, multiple linear regression will be performed to reduce bias by capturing these omitted variables and use them as regressors. The results are shown in columns 2-4 of Table 2.

By comparing the measures of fit across the four models, with the increase in R-squared, it infers the added regressors have helped to explain the variance in death rate, a better fit. For SPEC2 and SPEC3, the adjusted R-squared is penalized for the addition of a regressor, though very so slightly as n is large, it indicates that the fit is improved from the added regressor. The decrease in SER indicates that the average size of prediction errors is smaller, an increase in prediction accuracy.

Notice that in SPEC3 and SPEC4 a regressor of full vax rate squared is added, the purpose is to explore the potential quadratic relationship between death rate and full vax rate. For SPEC3, the t-statistic for the squared term is 0.98 which implies a lack of statistical significance. However, for SPEC4, where more controlled variables are considered, the t-statistic is 2.29, causing a rejection in the claim that there is no quadratic relationship. To interpret this, by taking the partial derivative with respect to full vax rate in SPEC4, it implies that at zero full vax rate, a 1% increase of full vax rate will on average reduce the death rate by roughly 1.034 units. However, the effect is 0.022 units smaller for every 1% increase beyond this point. This implies a diminishing return of benefit from full vaccination, coinciding with theory definition, and may suggest to health departments to focus on the supply of vaccines in the early stage, when the benefit is larger.

Besides the full vax squared term in SPEC3, Table 4 suggests statistical significance in all other regressors. Notice that the effect of GOP vote share decreased to -0.14 when full vax rate is added and returning to 0.37 (~0.38) when controls are added. The decrease implies that by holding the full vax rate constant, a 1% increase in GOP vote share causes a 0.14 decrease in the death rate. The return to 0.37 implies that by controlling the full vax rate, behavioral and demographic traits, a 1% increase of GOP vote share will still positively increase the death rate by 0.37 units. The negative coefficients of full vax rate in the MLRs mean that, on average, an increase in full vax rate has positive effects in reducing the death rate. Combined with the negative correlation with GOP vote share, it infers that there is a positive omitted variable bias in the first place.

As for the model assumptions, random sampling holds as is inherited from SLR2. Perfect collinearity, MLR3, is avoided by omitting necessary variables, noted in Table 2. As the adjusted R-squared values are still far from 1, it infers that the MLR is still unable to fully explain variance and fit a linear model, hence violating MLR1. In addition, failure to explain variance makes it impossible to support MLR4, the assumption regarding the distribution of error terms. In general, the MLR attempts to improve the model but is still far from accurate and hard to prove assumptions.

# Limitations of Results
Although the sample is collected through SRSWR, if the initial pool of 3000 counties is biased, then the sampled data will have selection bias. In addition, recall that the measures of fit still do not reflect a ‚Äúgood‚Äù linear fit in the model, and there may still be omitted variable bias due to an inexhaustive inclusion of controlled variables. For example, the full vax rate can be affected by the local restrictions, which are not covered in the regressors, and this may in effect influence the death rate. The potential influencer of ‚Äúrestriction‚Äù can also be correlated to the GOP vote share, such that as initially stated, red counties are less constrained by lockdowns. So, the true underlying causal effect may be between the ‚Äúlevel of restrictions‚Äù and death rate, and GOP vote share is only a descriptive placeholder for restriction. In general, the most important threat in the models is the ability to satisfy all the assumptions, especially to fit a perfect linear model, explain all the variance, and have the error terms symmetrically distributed around the estimated line.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this analysis with 2995 randomly selected counties brings many insights into how the death rate is related and possibly caused by GOP vote share and full vax rate. Hypothesis tests of coefficients suggest that these variables are not unrelated, which brings motivations for future research about how these variables relate, causal or descriptive, and try to meet the assumptions.
