# Executive Summary
## Potential Customers
To compete with Bitfit’s lower priced products, Mingar has expanded its product line with the
‘Active’ and ‘Advance’ lineups. A total of five products have been released for these two product
lines, with average prices of 73.32 and 132.5 for the two lines respectively. Comparing to Bitfit’s
two offerings for the cheapest ‘Fit’ lineup and five offerings for the middle tiered ‘Rush’ lineup, it
is clear that Mingar has enough products to compete against Bitfit’s low-end wearables. The
question now is how to market these newer products and attract potential customers.

In this report, we examine the characteristics of the customers who bought the newer products
(‘Active’ or ‘Advanced’). The results are summarised below:

- There is a negative relationship between the customer’s income level and the chance of
them purchasing the newer and more affordably products. Customers with lower income
levels are more likely to purchase products from the newer lineups. Specifically, when the
customer’s income level drops by 10,000, they are 20% more likely to purchase the newer
product over the traditional product.
- Comparing across the age groups, middle-aged adults around 44 years of age are least
likely to purchase the newer products. The further away they are from 44 years of age, the
greater the chance of them purchasing the newer product over the traditional product.
- We do not observe sex to be significant in affecting the customer’s product choice.

It is possible that the youth and seniors are the ones with lower income, and hence, prefer the
more affordable products. The suggestion for marketing campaign of the newer products is
to target the lower-income youth, or seniors. We believe that targeting the youth should be
prioritized as they have the potential to purchase the traditional products when their income
level rises and as age increases. In the traditional high-end wearables, Mingar has clear advantage
over Bitfit and should persist the market dominance.

## Poor sleep tracking performance for darker skin tones
To address the social media team’s concern regarding poor sleep tracking performances for users
with darker skin, we have analysed the impact of skin tone on the occurrences of poor quality
alarms during sleep sessions. Skin tone is predicted based on the emoji modifier set by the
customer, provided by Mingar. We have accounted for the possibility that the poor performance
is due to age or sex of the individual, duration of sleep session, device model, and allowing
individuals to differ for other unobserved characteristics. The results are summarised below:

- There is significant relationship between the predicted skin tone, such that for users with
darker predicted skin tones, the number of poor quality flags per hour in sleep is significantly
higher than the users with lighter predicted skin tones, details in Table 2.
- Age seems to positively affect the sleep tracker’s performance, such that older customers
have lower average number of flags per hour in sleep.
- There are significant differences between the sleeping behaviors across individuals. This
could be due to the different sleep patterns and quality for the individual, leading to
different sleep tracking performances. In addition, the impact of sleep duration also varies
across different individuals, such that an additional hour of sleep can affect customer A’s
sleep tracking performance different to customer B’s sleeping performance.
- The sex of the user is insignificant in impacting the sleep tracker’s performance.
- None of the devices, with the sleep tracking feature, are shown to have significantly better,
or worse, sleep tracking performance than the rest.

This result is stunning and may harm the company in multiple ways, such as being accused for
racism. Performance wise, it may discourage customers who get tanned easily, higher Fitzgerald
scores, to purchase Mingar’s products. This problem should be addressed immediately.

# Technical Report
## Introduction
### Background
In purpose to successfully expand Mingar’s new ‘Active’ and ‘Advanced’ product lines, and
compete with Bitfit in the competitive pricing market, it is important to realize the characteristics
of the customers who bought the new ‘Active’ or ‘Advanced’ products. We will call them the
“new customers” in the future. By identifying the traits of the new customers, Mingar can predict
the potential customers for the new products and undertake strategies to targets these customers,
such as purposely advertise to certain audiences.

This report will also address a concern from the social media team, regarding the poor sleep
tracking performances for customers with darker skin tones. To avoid the accusation for racism,
the report aims to provide an objective judgement for the influence of skin tone, predicted by
the emoji modifier set by the customer.

### Research Questions
Research Question 1: What factors affect a customer’s decision of purchasing the newer
product?

- In order to distinguish between the new customers and traditional customers of Mingar’s
products, we will first segment the customers based on their product.
- Based on the data provided by Mingar, we obtained the following information about each
customer: age, sex, estimated household income, which we will utilize to predict if the
customer has a new product or traditional product.
- We will focus on the impact of customer’s estimated income on the choice of product
purchase. This may explain the income effect and how product choice is affected by prices.

Research Question 2: Are darker skin tones associated with poorer sleep tracking
performances?
- With the customer’s sleep data, we will evaluate if the poor sleep tracking performance is
due to the customer’s predicted skin tone. Specifically, if the performance drops for darker
skin tones.
- We will try to obtain an unbiased result by netting out the effect of other factors, such as
age, sex, sleep duration, by incorporating them into the models.

# RQ1: How are the newer customers different from traditional customers?
## Method
Statistical Method For the first research question, we are estimating if a customer is “new”
or “traditional” based on their characteristics. Since the response is a binary, indicating new
customer or not, we will utilize the Logistic regression, a type of the Generalized Linear
Model (GLM) with a logit link function. The assumptions are evaluated below:

1. Binary Response: The response indicates if the observation is new customer or traditional.
2. Independence: Although it is possible that the same individuals may register multiple
accounts and be incorrectly measured multiple times, we will assume that the customer
data provided by Mingar are 1-to-1 and each customer is independent of one another.
3. Variance Structure: By definition, the variance of the response should be largest when
p=.5. For simplicity, we will assume this is true.
4. Linearity: The log odds ratio on the LHS of the regression must be a linear function of the
predictor variables. We will examine this in the next section using empirical logit plots.

To select the predictors, we will also follow this guideline using model comparison tests:

1. Start with the initial model consisting only of the income predictor, since it is the key
variable we with to make inference on.
2. Add additional predictors (sex/age), and add interactions if needed.
3. Assess if the added predictor is a significant improvement using Anova.
4. If significant, add this predictor, and vice versa.

## Data description and wrangling
In preparation for the regression analysis, we wish to collect as
many characteristic data about the customer as we can. Along with the customer data provided
by Mingar and additional data fom other sources, we are able to obtain the following variables:
- Sex: This corresponds to Female, Male, Intersex, or NA.
- Age (as of 2022): Obtained using the date of birth and subtracting from 2022.
- Estimated Household Income: Obtained using the postal code variable, the Canadian
census data, and postal conversion files. Addressed further in the appendix.

We originally have 19241 customers recorded. In order to make model comparison possible, we
will uniform the sample size by dropping any customer with missing values for the mentioned
variables. This gives a reduced sample size of 19045.

Table 3 describes the customers segmented by product type and sex. It demonstrates that the
newer customers have lower income compared to traditional customers, regardless of sex. This
aligns with our intuition as the newer products are at lower price levels, making it more affordable
for the lower income group. The average income for the three sex groups are generally equivalent,
inferring a small correlation between income and sex. Lastly, the proportion column indicates
that there are generally more newer customers than traditional customers.
![Table3](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=14ZWfmPbKHGcOnXLyx0AOSyHoqtDyOcIM)
In Figure 1, the empirical logit plot illustrates the relationship between the transformed response
(log odds ratio) and age group, segmented by household income level below and above the median
of 65829. The points show a parabola shape, so we want to use a quadratic term for age in our
model to satisfy the linearity assumption. We observe similar shapes for the two income levels,
inferring that an interaction may not be necessary. Similar trend is observed when segmenting
by sex, shown Figure 5 in the appendix.
![Figure1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1k4yd1dZsrAfKMUIocYepCehI76q-9Zi9)
Finally, we explore the income variable, the estimated household median income based on the
customer’s postal code location. The empirical logit plot in Figure 2 indicates no obvious
violations to the linearity assumption, but be aware of the lack of data points for the high income
group. The graph conveys a negative relationship between income level and the log odd ratio
for purchasing the new product, aligning with our prior belief from Table 3. In addition, by
segmenting the customers by sex, we observe slightly different slopes, shown in Figure 6 in the
appendix. Hence, we might need an interaction between income and sex.
![Figure2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1MxPeMtVoD-2_kuPe_NZqA55SnsKtLtSY)
## Result
### Initial Models
In Table 4, the process of selecting predictors is shown. Generally, it is shown that
neither adding sex as a predictor itself nor adding sex as an interaction with income significantly
improves the model. This is different from the different slopes between sex groups observed in the
empirical logit plot. Adding age as a quadratic term significantly improves the model. Finally, a
model that interacts age and income is fit, and the results coincide with prior conclusions, such
that the interaction is insignificant.
![Table4a](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1lTbhLDVdSDhQ2kClOn1FnxHyZhyQ6nHt)
![Table4b](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1Vu2kVtCeu0xakF3wcHrKWOouKE2Zl52F)
### Final Model
Final Model The final model is the one fit in step 4, consisting of income and age, with a
quadratic term for age. To make the intercept interpretable, we have centered the age variable
respective to the median age, 47. The final model is given as:
![Table5](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1kPK0JL6fgNUlq3JD4Ab4S2Ar7k6WWySB)
In Table 5, the odds parameters are listed. Due to the small standard errors, we observe
very narrow confidence intervals, and we are quite confident with the point estimates. For the
predictors, the 95% confidence intervals are strictly on one side of 1.0. This indicated a strictly
positive or negative multiplicative effect. According to the results, at baseline, such that for
customers with an estimated household income of 65829 and 47 years of age, the log odds for this
person to be a new customer is roughly 1. This corresponds to p/(1−p) = 1, hence, the probability
for this customer to have a new product is p = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, a 50% chance! Obviously, this result is
not very helpful as it is no different to flipping a coin. When focusing on the change of log odds
ratio due to a change in income, we find that a 1000 increase in income leads to a 2% decrease in
the odds of the customer having a new product. It also means that by decreasing income by
1000, the odds of the customer having a new product increases by 2%.

Figure 3 visualizes the impact of the quadratic age term. As age increases, the odds of having a
new product decreases more and more drastically. It is until the point when age increased to
roughly 44.455, when additional increases from that point leads to an increase of the odds. In
other words, for every customer younger than 44.455 years old, they have a lower odds of having
a new product compared to someone younger than them. On the other hand, for every customer
older than 44.455 years old, they have a greater odds of having a new product compared to
someone younger than them. Lastly, it is until when age is above 88.91 that the odds is greater
than baseline. This trend matches what we observed in the Figure 1.
![Figure3](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1Z1fmOND35zfD7LgAgUukAoKl2s4oii8T)
## Discussion
In conclusion, by fitting a logistic regression model to predict if a customer has a new product
or traditional product, results show that income is negatively associated with the odds of the
customer having a new product. For instance, a 10000 decrease in the estimated household
income increases the odds of the customer to have an ‘Active’ or ‘Advanced’ product. This infers
that with respect to the traditional product line, the new product line more greatly attracts the
lower income customers. In addition, we have found a quadratic relationship between age and
new customers. In short, while the customers’ ages range from 18 to 92, the further away the
age is from 44-45 years old, the greater the odds of them being a new customer. In other words,
the odds becomes greater for young customers close to 18 years old, or old customers close to 92
years old. Finally, during the model fitting process, the result of anova tests indicate that sex is
insignificant in predicting the customer’s product type.

## Limitations
Several limitations exist as we tackled this problem. First, we have directly removed the
observations with missing values for the variables that we are interested in, which only occurred
for the variable recording sex. If the removed customers are impactfully different from the others,
then it can cause a bias issue. For example, these may be the high income customers who
bought the newer products, but do not want to expose too much personal information. Another
limitation is regarding the income variable. Notice in Figure 2, the number of data points for
income levels greater than 100k becomes significantly fewer, meaning we do not know their
preferences in choosing the products. Hence, the model would be pulled towards the leverage
point, the roughly 200k income group, making the model inaccurate.

This project can be constantly updated as Mingar accumulates more customers, which helps to
reduce the bias caused by missing observations or observations with missing values. Hence, a
long term partnership with Pengy Analytics is preferrable.

# RQ2: The relationship between Skin Tone and Sleep Tracker’s Performance
## Method
### Statistical Method
For the second research question, we will be predicting the sleep tracker’s
performance based on the flags variable, which is provided by Mingar in the customer sleep
data, representing the number of times a quality flag was reported during one sleep session, due
to missing data, unusual, or other quality issues. For the sleep data, we record sleep data for 974
customers for multiple sleep sessions. We will utilize a Poisson regression with mixed effects, a
generalized linear mixed model, to capture the discrete response using the poisson distribution,
and the multiple observations for the same customer using random effects. The assumptions for
GLMM are:

1. Independent: The customers are independent to one another, allowing within customer
variation.
2. Normal Random Effects: For simplicity, we will assume this holds.
3. Homogeneous Random Effect Errors and Within-unit Residual Errors: For simplicity, we
will also assume this holds.
4. The response is poisson distributed: We know the response is discrete, but we will investigate
if mean = variance.
To account for the fact that more flags can be due to the longer sleep duration, we have included
an offset of log(duration(hours))so after fitting the model, we can interpret the response as flags
per hour slept. This enables us to make comparisons between individuals with different average
sleep duration.

To select the predictors, including the fixed effects and random effects, we will follow the same
guideline to the approach for the previous section. The only difference is that when comparing
models with same fixed effects but different random effects, we apply the likelihood ratio test
instead of the anova test.

### Data Description and wrangling
To prepare the data, we have first merged some additional
data about each customer, including sex, device, age, and the predicted skin tone. While age
and sex are identical to the previous section, these are the new variables:

1. Predicted Skin Tone: Based on the emoji-modifer set by the customer, we predict the
customer’s skin tone.
2. Device: Represents the device worn by the customer during sleep.
3. Duration (hours): Represents the sleep duration for each observation, in hours.
We find 255 customers with either missing values for sex, or did not choose an emoji modifier, and
they are removed to keep the sample size constant for regressions. We do not include customers
who did not select an emoji modifier because we cannot predict their skin tone, and hence,
unable to distinguish them from the others. This disallows us from making inferences, so they
are excluded from this study, leading to a limitation.

Figure 4 illustrates the average number of flags reported by each customer, grouped by different
predicted skin tones. Noticeably, the average number of flags increases as we move down the
Fitzpatrick scale. i.e, darker skin color. The upward curving trend suggests that the number
of flags can be modeled by taking a log for its mean and use predicted skin tone as prediction,
showing assumption 4 holding. However, based on the means and variances across groups, there
seem to be modest violations as variance becomes larger than mean for darker skin tones.
![Figure4](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1H4YVvHuGjwn0MjQZ6HfHXGqEgtTNwxLx)
Table 6 also suggests a violation to the mean=variance assumption as we see the variance is
greatly larger than the mean for across all age groups. The means infer a potential negative
association between flags and age, which may be explain by the shorter sleeps as age increases.
![Table6](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1Mho7ATl0PkfqW4RC5Q4EvoZbuJ8LmuyV)
## Result
### Initial Models
The initial model consists of variable that we are mostly interested in, the
predicted skin tone. We also include the random intercept effect term for the customer and
allowing within unit variation. In the process, we have found age to be significant in predicting
the response, and we have to rescale it by dividing by 10 as suggested by the glmer() function.
On the other hand, sex and device is insignificant. This means that we do not observe certain
devices performing better or worse compared to others. Lastly, an random slope of duration, in
hours over 10, is found to be significant, which will be discussed later.
![Table7](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=/1i8VOIWVi7FWBst48DL1UpO3Spb0XSQFt)
### Final Model
For the final model, we have also centered the age variable around the median of
46, which is 0.46 after rescaling. After rearrangement of the offset, the final model is given as:
![FinalModel2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=/1vP4p3KU05EhN4vRMfuJZ1IYOjTyGCvA4)
For the random effects, we want to focus on the duration random slope effect. Intuitively, this
captures the random effect for a customer being themselves, while accounting for the duration
per session. For instance, an additional hour of sleep for customer A may impact the response
differently than an additional hour of sleep for customer B.
![Table8](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=/1yDtYmGpjUuVwsPLJOq3k9F8f9qPH5wXx)
Table 8 shows some stunning results. First, all the point estimates are found to be very significant,
with small p-values and narrow confident intervals, so we are confident in the point estimates.
The baseline odds infers that for a customer 46 years of age who we predict to have a light skin
tone, the estimated average flag per hour slept is roughly 0.18. The estimations for the skin tone
predictors can be interpreted as the multiplicative effect with respect to the baseline, light skin
tone. For instance, customers of age 46 who we predict to have a medium-light skin tone has a
predicted flags per hour slept that is 2.17 times greater than the baseline. This corresponds to a
predicted 0.18 · 2.17 = 0.3906 flags per hour. The multiplicative effect increases as we move up
the Fitzgerald scale, such that for customers predicted to have a dark skin tone, their estimated
flags per hour is 10.96 times greater than the customers with light skin tone! Moving onto the
age predictor, there is a negative association between age and the response, such that a 10 year
increase in age reduces flags per duration by 6%. This coincides with prior belief in Table 6.

## Discussion
By fitting a Poisson regression model with mixed effects, we find that even after accounting for
the individual and duration random effects, both the predicted skin tone and age variables are
found to be very significant in impacting the customer’s flags per hour slept score. In other
words, the effect of skin tone applies to all individuals with that predicted skin tone, equally
and consistently. Results show that for customers with more tan skin tones, they have higher
estimated flags per hour slept scores. In other words, the sleep tracking unit on the Mingar
watches are performing worse when the wearer’s skin tone increases in the Fitzgerald scale.
Specifically, customers with the tannest skins have an estimated 10.96 times greater flags per
hour score compared to those with the least tan skin tones. In addition, results show that the
flags per hour is lower for older customers, compared to younger customers, potentially due to
the fewer hours slept as age increases.

## Limitations
Similar to the first research question, a limitation is the decision to remove observations with
missing values. Another limitation is the choice of not diving deeper into the assumption checking
and model diagnostics, specifically the assumptions for normal random effects and homogeneous
errors. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the mean=variance assumption is potentially violated,
which could lead to misfitted models. When constructing the confidence intervals, we have
utilized the Wald method, instead of the profile likelihoods due to computation difficulties. This
results in less accurate confidence intervals

In addition to wishing for more data, future projects should aim to perform model diagnostics
to the models, as well as finding ways to compute the confidence intervals using the profile
likelihood. Another possible goal is to visualize the random effects.
