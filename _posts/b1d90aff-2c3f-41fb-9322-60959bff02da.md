# Abstract
In this paper, we have focused on exploring the impact of connections on the election for the Politburo, the highest groups representing China. We are interested in studying the role of college connections between candidates and incumbent members, and how a non-democratic government deals with factionalist, a potential threat to the operations of the Chinese Communist Party. By utilizing linear regressions to predict the chance of promotion, as more controls and fixed effects are added, improving the accuracy of the model, we observe that having college connections will negatively impact the candidate’s chance of promotion, coinciding with the anti-factionalist focus in the CCP. We have also noticed how having connections with a senior member, ones in the Politburo Standing Committee, induces a weaker impact on promotion than having connections with a junior member, due to a lower risk for the senior members to be directly replaced by a member from outside the Politburo.
# Introduction
In this paper, we will explore the nature of anti-factionalist in the CCP, and how it impacts the chance of promotion. Since Mao’s leadership, the CCP has suppressed and punished factionalist, where individuals with shared backgrounds form alliances to their own benefits, breaking the core ideology of communism. Xi’s leadership re-emphasized this, with more central committee members being penalized since the 18th term than the period from the 8th to 17th term (BBC News, 2017). To prevent factionalism, the government paid extra attention to possible connections between the incumbent members and candidates, such as being old acquaintance, fellow townsman, schoolmate, etc, and potentially lower the chance of promotion for a member with connections. For this paper, we will focus on college connections and examine how having college connections with an incumbent member may affect a candidate’s chance of electing to the Politburo.
# The Context and Data
This study uses the panel data set organized by Fisman et al, which consists of the information of all Central Committee members from the seventh (1945-1956) to nineteenth term (2017-2022) (Fisman et al, 2020). The data is prepared using information on the People’s Daily Online and Political Elites of the Communist Party of China (National Chengchi University 2019); while members missing from this database was individually searched on Baidu Baike (Fisman et al., 2020). Since we have no data about the sixth term, we do not know the connections of candidates for the seventh term, hence, the first connection is between a candidate for the eighth term and a Politburo member in the seventh term. Therefore, we are only interested in the Central Committee members since the eighth term to the nineteenth term.

Table 1 includes the summary statistics of the variables used for the base regressions, where we are specifically looking at the sample of 1357 observations that are used across all the regressions. Means, in this case, represent the proportion of individuals that satisfy the condition described by the variable, except for age and prior candidacies, which are numeric. By comparing across the two groups, results show that candidates that had a college connection with an incumbent member have 2% more chance on promotion, compared to the candidates that did not have a college tie; however, this difference is shown to be insignificant. In addition, we notice two significant differences, age, and military. It is shown that candidates with college connections are in average 59.7 years old, which is roughly one year older than the candidates without. This may infer that this group’s higher elected rate may also be due to seniority.
# Regression Analysis
We will utilize linear regressions to predict the chance of the candidate being promoted. Hence, the response variable will be ismember, a binary variable denoting if the candidate is elected to the Politburo. Throughout the regressions, we will utilize heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the individual level to allow correlations between observations, since an individual can be observed more than once in the data set. Under the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, this estimator is consistent when the sample size gets large, which we can assume to be the case for this study with 1357 observations. Therefore, it enables us to apply hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The results are shown in Table 2.
## Simple Linear Regression
To start of, we will fit a SLR predicting ismember, the dependent variable, based on the independent variable of collegetie, which is another indicator variable denoting if the candidate shares the same graduation college(s) with an incumbent member in the Politburo.
![Table2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1zwLzbl1RpGYv6g0uGHQZmU6lLUTlrAMv)
To interpret this model, column 1 in Table 2, we apply some simple proportions. Consider two groups, first, the group of candidates without a college tie. The constant, 0.0674, represents the proportion of candidates within this group that is a member in the Politburo. This can be verified using the data, which is given as 75/1112≈0.0674. For the estimated coefficient on collegetie, it represents the change in this proportion when we switch to the group of candidates with college connections. There are 245 candidates with college connections, where 22 of them are in the Politburo, giving the proportion of 22/245≈0.0898. Therefore, the change in proportion is roughly 0.0224≈0.0223, due to rounding errors. In other words, this implies that if the candidate has a college connection, then there is a 2.23% increase in the chance of being elected to the Politburo. This indicates a positive affect of having college ties on the chance of promotion, which is also practically significant (large), considering only 7.15% of the candidates were elected. The result seems contradictory to our hypothesis.

Lastly, we construct a 95% confidence interval for the estimated coefficient on collegetie. By assuming that our sample size is sufficient, the 95% confidence interval is {0.0223±1.96×0.0194}≈{-0.0157,0.0603}. This is one of the 95% of intervals that contains the true parameter value, such that the true effect of having college connection can be as low as -1.57% to as high as 6.03%. This also infers that at a 5% level, the impact could be 0%, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis, so the influence of collegetie is statistically insignificant here.
## Multiple Linear Regression: Individual Controls
To improve the model, we will include controls for individual traits such as age and prior candidacies. We believe that these traits may play a role in affecting whether the candidate is elected or not. The result for this MLR is included in column 2 of Table 2. We notice that the model is performing better than the SLR, such that R-squared has significantly increased.

We notice that the estimated coefficient on collegetie dropped to 0.0177, inferring that having college connection leads to a 1.77% increase in the chance of promotion. This coefficient is less practically significant and is still statistically insignificant as 0.0177/0.0181≈0.978<1.96. There are two highly statistically and practically significant control variables, Prior Candidacies and Four Party Secretary. Prior Candidacies represent the number of previous terms the candidate served in the Central Committee, and the result has shown that for an additional term of prior experience, the chance of being elected increases by an average of 5.2%. Again, this positive influence is practically significant, such that candidates with two terms of experience will have more than double the chance of promotion. Four Party Secretary denotes if the candidate “is the party secretary of one of the directly controlled municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin”, or of Guangdong. The estimated coefficient indicates that these candidates have a 71.6% increase in the chance of promotion. The practical significance is stunningly large and might be explained by the fact that out of the 17 candidates who were the four party secretaries, 14 of them were elected to the Politburo, roughly 82.4%. This coincides with prior belief and contextual evidence such that the party secretaries for these four cities are top candidates for entering the Politburo, or even guaranteed into the Politburo, as the specialness of municipalities require their secretaries to hold more responsibilities (HanLinYuan, 2020).

This model may still suffer from omitted variable bias (OVB). As Fisman et al. have stated, “[s]imply controlling for higher educational attainment does not account for the difference between Tsinghua versus lower-tier institutions” (Fisman et al., 2020). Hence, we want to consider the time invariant factor of the candidate’s university. For instance, by assuming that the Politburo members mostly graduate from common prestigious universities, candidates who graduate from uncommon, lower-tier institutions, will have a lower chance of having college connection and being elected, which satisfies the conditions for OVB. Since a candidate is technically impossible to graduate from another college between terms, we can assume that university vary across individuals, but stays the same over time, making it time invariant.
## Multiple Lienar Regression: Individual Controls, College Fixed Effects
By including the college fixed effect in the third specification, column 3 of Table 2, we are accounting for the unobserved effects that different universities have on its candidates’ promotions, which does not change across time. This enables us to net out the effect of college when comparing individuals with the same college background across different terms.

The result shows a remarkable increase in R-squared and a drastic change in the estimated coefficient of collegetie. By adding in college fixed effects, it is shown that collegetie has a negative influence on the candidate’s promotion, such that having college connection leads to a 6.32% decrease in the chance of promotion, which is practically significant. In this model, the p-value of college connection is P(|T|>0.0632/0.0330)=0.055, which is statistically significant at a 10% level, but not significant enough for an 5% level.

Now we want to consider the candidate invariant omitted variable, how different terms impact its candidates. For instance, the sizes of the Politburo may differ, such as term 8 and 13 only included 17 members, when most terms have 25 members (People’s Daily Online). As the size decreases, less members will be promoted, so the chance of promotion decreases for all the candidates. In addition, candidates for the following term (9 and 14) are less likely to have college ties because less incumbent members means less variation in colleges, which indicates endogeneity where collegetie is correlated with the error term. This is a time varying factor that satisfies the condition for OVB, which will result in biased estimators, such that part of the effect of collegetie could be explained by term size.
## Multiple Lienar Regression: Individual Controls, College and Term Fixed Effects
Therefore, we will add in Term fixed effects to incorporate for the unobserved effects and the general trends in promotion rate that each term has on the candidates. Similarly, we expect each term to have equal influence on all its candidates. Now we have accounted for the college and term fixed effects, which net out all the potential unobserved effects that college and term will have on the chance of promotion and allow us to compare individuals with the same graduation college and are electing for the same term. In other words, although we do not know how different terms or colleges have different impacts, resulting in heterogeneity, we assume that for a fixed set of term and college, they have the equal impact across candidates.
Results in column 4 of Table 2 indicate a further drop in the estimated coefficient of college tie, such that if candidates with college connection have 9.33% lower chance of promotion. While this is more practically significant, it is also statistically significant with a p-value as low as 0.0056. The 95% confidence interval reports {-0.159,-0.0272}, which is one of the 95%
intervals that capture the true relationship between college connection and chance of electing, which indicates a negative influence of at most 15.9% and at least 2.72%. This negative impact coincides with our hypothesis.

Now we are interested in finding if the individual controls that we have added in the second specification to be jointly statistically significant. We will do so using the F-statistic with the null hypothesis, 𝐻0, stated as none of the individual controls have a influence on the candidate’s promotion, and the alternative hypothesis, 𝐻A, stating at least one of these individual controls are significant. The F-statistic includes nine restrictions and 725 degrees of freedom. The F-statistic is found to be 12.23 and yields a p-value of 0.0000. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis and state that at least one of these control variables are statistically significant, and thus, the individual controls are jointly statistically significant in predicting the chance of promotion.

## Extension: Connection with PSC vs non-PSC members
Within the Politburo, the standing committee (PSC – highest representative of CCP) takes up roughly a third of the members. Members usually serve as least one term in the Politburo before being promoted to the PSC. In our data, only 13 candidates were directly promoted to the PSC (Fismen et al., 2020). Considering this with anti-factionalist, it is intuitive to think that Politburo members who are not in the standing committee will be more concerned about potential connections because it induces a risk of being investigated for factionalist and replacement. On the other hand, members in the PSC are less concerned due to the lower risk of being replaced. For the extension, we explore how connecting with a PSC versus non-PSC impact candidates differently. Since factionalist can occur between fellow townsmen, we will also consider hometown ties, sharing the same hometown with an incumbent member. We have also included hometown fixed effect, such that city populations may lead to varying degrees of competition and chances of having connections. The result is shown in Table 3.
![Table3](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1T38iu_uHUap6lKeQorV8O5i5p8xF9muw)
The general trend we observe coincides with our expectations, such that having connections with non-PSC members will result in larger disadvantage in the promotion. For instance, if the college tie is with a non-PSC member, then the chance of election is 4.39% lower than a PSC member connection. In fact, having hometown connection with a PSC member is estimated to have a positive 4.28% influence on the chance of election. However, p-values indicate that the differences between the two groups are not statistically significant, 0.54 and 0.18, and most of the connections are not statistically significant except for having college connection with a non-PSC member. Moreover, by testing the four new predictors that indicate connection types, F-statistic gives a p-value of 0.0793, which is only jointly statistically significant at a 10% level.

In this model, we observe that the R-squared increased from 0.327 in specification 4 to 0.418, inferring that the model is explaining more variation in the chance of promotion with additional predictors. In addition, we are now using only 1306 observations to fit the model.
# Limitations
The models in this paper do not fully include the variables that may influence the selection process, which still suffers from omitted variable bias. For instance, by how the government defines possible connections, it is likely that members with workplace or family connections are also considered as connected. While anti-factionalist suggests that connections would have causal effects on promotion, the models were unable to consistently provide significant results, which gives more descriptive conclusions in the relationships. In addition, potential variables that impact promotion may include performance, of the public image.

Due to the nature of elections and how we measured connections, there is a “mechanical negative relationship between [group] connections and [promotion]”, as Fisman et al. have stated. For example, if the Politburo did not have any member from Shandong in the 17th term, but one member from Shandong was promoted on the 18th term, then the group of candidates from Shandong will mechanically have a hometown tie in the latter term. However, candidates from Shandong are less likely to be elected in the future due to anti-factionalist. Therefore, group fixed effects may induce bias on the group from Shandong by predicting the candidates to have a lower chance of promotion due to hometown connection.
# Conclusion
In conclusion, this paper has examined the impact of having connections on the chance of promoting into the Politburo, which is influenced by anti-factionalist. By progressively adding in more controls and fixed effects, we observe that as the models get more accurate, candidates who have college connections have a lower chance of promoting into the Politburo, coinciding with our hypothesis. In the extension, we focused on how the connection with a senior member in the PSC, rather than a junior non-PSC member, influences the chance of promotion differently, and we have also considered hometown connections. We notice that as the senior members are less threatened by the chance of being directly replaced by a member from the Central Committee, connections with them have lower impact on the candidate’s promotion rate. In future research, we recommend considering more factors that may influence promotion rate and overcoming the potential bias that our method induces by modifying the dataset.
