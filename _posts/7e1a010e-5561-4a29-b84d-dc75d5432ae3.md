# Important Note
The project was started and completed during my time at TMX 2022 summer. Due to confidentiality reasons, details are hidden, but I will use words to summarise the workflow. I also do not have most of the work I've done, so it's mostly written from memory.

# Introduction
As the Canadian financial service company that operates TSX and TSXV, TMX stores hundreds of thousands of fund fact sheets in its database. These fund fact sheets contain key information on the fund's recent performance and composition. Although TMX has these fact sheets, it has been a pain to extract the information from them, such as the MER (Management Expense Ratio), TER (Trading Expense Ratio), Date listed. After acquiring the New York based company, ETF Logic, which specializes in Data Analytics and Visualization and owns the dashboard product Logicly, TMX aims to provide an easy-to-use and accurate data visualization website to its existing clients and potential customers.

Data on Logicly is mainly obtained from third party data providers, and the goal of this project is to conduct data validation and reduce the reliant on third party providers. This is where the value of TMX's fund fact sheet database is, such that if we are able to extract the information ourselves, we eliminate the the economic and communication cost associated with third party data providers. 

# Fund Fact Sheet Example
The fund fact sheet below is for Harvest ETF's fund, listed under the symbol ORBT. It follows the general structure of a fund fact sheets for any Canadian ETF. The goal is to extract the key information pairs, such as "Management expense ratio (MER): 0.79%" using an automated algorithm for any fund fact sheet similar to this using one-click.

# Difficulties & Solutions
## Parsing PDF in general
There are multiple python packages out there that converts a pdf file to a txt file by scraping the test information. However, they all perform differently, such as messing up the row ordering, messy table structures, etc. Some packages even couldn't extract a single word from the pdf due to encryption issues. 

After comparing several packages including pdftotext, PyPDF2, pdfminer, and even pytessaract, which uses optimal character recognition, I settles on pdftotext, which performed the best, especially when setting argument "raw = True" in pdftotext.PDF(). This minimizes the issues caused by strange formats, and presents the texts in the original order as when they were compiled to a pdf. The OCR method used by pytessaract is, although pertaining the formats of the pdf, under performing on accurately extracting the characters, since it is treating the pdf as an image. For example, a capitalized O could be extracted as a number 0, which is painful to convert in further steps.

## Different Naming
Although fund fact sheets follow a general guideline, there is no requirement on the exact wording. For example, company A might name its MER as "MER: 0.79", while company B might name its MER as "Management expense ratio: 0.79%" and company C calling it "MER^1: 0.79%" with a superscript. The key is to correctly locate the key information from every fund fact sheet and extract the value associated with it. 

I like to give the example of lock and key pairs when discussing this issue. Imagine each fact sheet is a lock, and we want to extract the numbers inside it. We need to open this lock with a key, and that is regular expression, or regex in short. For anyone unfamiliar with regex, it defines a pattern that can match to a string. For example "^A[a-z]{4}" would match to any 5 letter word that starts with a capital A. Now, the decision is to create a key that can unlock every lock, or create a separate key for each lock. 

In the end, the decision is both. While we should have a powerful regex that recognizes most [Label]: [Value] pairs, we should also have separate regex for different labels, or pairs so peculiar that is extremely difficult to merge into the other regex. Hence, in my program, I have enabled the possibility of adding designated regex for different fund companies, since different companies have their own naming conventions. 

# Connection with Amazon S3
In this project, I have also experienced with working with Amazon S3 to pull data using the Boto3 package in python. I wrote a script to navigate to the correct folder and update the fund information with the newest fact sheets. 
 
# Final Result
In the end, I was able to parse 95%+ of the ETF fact sheets automatically, and key information including the fund name, fund symbol, fund start date, MER, TER, ETF Expense Ratio, total value, fund manager, etc. The product is extremely helpful when conducting data validation tasks for Logicly, as we are able to fix the third party data issues with our own data, eliminating the time cost of communicating with the third party data providers. For any missing data, we can also immediately fill them in with our data. We also found many discrepancies between our parsed data and the third party data, which helps us to identify data issues. 

Ultimately, this project provided huge supports to improve data accuracy for the ETF dashboard product Logicly and provide the clients with the best data possible.
