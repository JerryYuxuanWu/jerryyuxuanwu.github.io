# Introduction
## Goal
This paper will explore the relationship between death rate and commute time using different transportation methods in the 152 census metropolitan and agglomerate areas in Canada by using linear regression and its supplementary tools. We focus on providing valid results that lead to accurate conclusions and future research.
## Importance
Data shows that from 1996 to 2016, fewer Canadians are commuting by car, and more are choosing public transit or active transit, such as walking or biking (Katherine Savage, 2019). This may infer that people are avoiding the risk of driving, which leads to worse physical health, as suggested by Ding’s paper (Ding et al., 2014). Through this research, we get to identify if increasing the time on a certain mode of commuting significantly affects the cities’ death rate.

# Methods
## Variable Selection
We utilized the linear regression model to estimate a city’s death rate based on the average commute time on different modes of transportations. Therefore, the response variable is the death rate, in percent, of the above 15 age group. As the type of commuting is less of a choice and unlikely to directly cause death for the under 15 age group, we choose to exclude them.

To ensure the accuracy of these results, the following tasks were performed in advance.

Model diagnostics were performed to check for assumption violations.

The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is utilized to check for multicollinearity, and variables with VIF > 5 are considered to have severe multicollinearity issues. Predictors with severe multicollinearity were removed to improve the accuracy of test results. Only some predictors were removed at once since removing some might also reduce the VIF for the other predictors. Partial-F test was used when removing predictors to check if these predictors are jointly insignificant.

Once the assumptions were satisfied at their best, we utilized a combination of hypothesis testing, adjust R-squared and likelihood-based measures to obtain the best models, which differ by the number and choice of predictors. The final model is selected based on the result of the model validation process.

## Model Validation
To ensure that the final model can be applied on a data set from the same population, we will split the original data set into a training set and a testing set. We chose a training set of size 100 to ensure a sufficient sample size for the model fitting process. This leads to a limitation as the training set only had 52 samples, which we will discuss later.

Generally, we selected the predictors for the final model by applying the procedure in 2.1 using
the training set and then attempted to fit the final models using the testing set to examine if the
assumptions and regression results are consistent in terms of the estimated coefficients,
significance, and adjusted R-squared.

Lastly, we identified leverage, outlier, and influential observations to justify any inconsistencies
in the validation process.
## Model Diagnostics
Assumptions were checked for every fitted model using the response versus fitted value plot for
condition 1, predictor versus predictor plots for condition 2, residual versus response/predictor
plot, and the normal Q-Q plot for homoscedasticity and normality assumptions. Standardized
Residuals were utilized throughout the research to account for the potential leverage points.

To deal with normality violations, Box-Cox transformations were performed on the variables. The
choice of which variables to transform, response, predictors, or all, was based on the result of
diagnostics, such that if condition 2 is violated, it is necessary to transform the predictors. Models
were fit using the transformed variables and were then compared with each other based on how
well they solved the violations.

Generally, Box-Cox transformation will fix heteroscedasticity along with normality and linearity,
but in the situation in which it does not, we address the violations in the limitations and interpret
the test results with caution.

# Results
## Data Description
This paper utilized a cross-sectional data set combined from multiple tables in the 2016 Canada
Census. Table 1 describes the training data.
![table1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1DP9mEQhsPNACG-WT1oaL7pe84bYDGwVz)
Table 1 indicates that for the training set, the death rate is on average 1.15%, and it is roughly
normal with a potential outlier as shown in Figure A.1 in the appendix.

For the predictors, commute times are mostly skewed as there are clear discrepancies between
mean and median. This might lead to larger variance and potential influential points. In addition,
we notice that the three variables, Subway…, Light rail…, and Passenger ferry are mostly zeros,
such that it is not available for the city, so we modified them into binary indicator variables to
avoid issues during transformations.

##Final Model Selection Process
To select the predictors, we started by fitting the full model with all the available predictors, which
gave a model with a low adjusted R-squared of about 0.1 and an F-statistic of 1.523, inferring that
the predictors are not jointly significant at a 10% level. However, these results may be inaccurate
due to possible assumption violations.

As shown in Figure A2.b, condition 1 is generally satisfied for the full model. Pairwise graphs
show fanning patterns and non-linear relationships between several predictors, indicating
condition 2 violations. Fanning patterns in residual plots and imperfect normal Q-Q plot also
reflected non-normality issues.

Therefore, both Box-Cox transformations, on all variables or only on predictor variables, were
attempted. The result suggested keeping the response variable as it is, and for the predictor
variables, the two approaches only differ in one transformation. Hence, we chose the approach
when we try to transform all the variables as it considered the response when calculating the
transformations.

Fitting the full model using the transformed variables fixed the violations slightly, such as the
improvement in condition 1 in Figure A2. In Figure 1, notice the change in some of the pairwise
graphs, fixing the fanning pattern and non-linearity.

Then we identified variables with severe multicollinearity, VIF>5. When variables like Car, truck,
van as driver, and Driver alone, both showed extremely large VIF, 1185 and 327 accordingly, we
chose to first remove the former and keep the latter, hoping that with one’s removal, the other’s
VIF will be fixed. This technique was utilized multiple times, and the general rule followed is to
keep the more specific predictor and remove the general one. We removed 7 predictors based on
the VIF result in two iterations, as both partial-F tests failed to reject the null hypothesis and
assumptions did not worsen.

As assumptions were mostly satisfied and multicollinearity was solved, we applied the best
possible subset using adjusted R-squared, forward/backward/stepwise AIC and BIC, to obtain the
top two models based on the training data set. The results are shown in Table 2.
![table2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1AnQQ5ZGBIyYmcBsdKhVg-KKtDwdRxHI8)
We obtained two candidates for the final model, the 7-predictor model based on the highest
adjusted R-squared, and the 4-predictor model based on the lowest AIC. In fact, this is suggested
by all forward/backward/stepwise approaches. On the other hand, BIC suggested a 1-predictor
model, which is not informative and yielded an adjusted R-squared of only 0.0726 on the training
data, so we eliminated it.

Generally, the two candidates satisfied the assumptions almost equally, and the difference is in the
3 predictors, which increased the adjusted R-squared by 0.01. The full result for the right-most 4
models is included in Table A.1.

## Final Model Validation
We have fitted the models using the test data set after transforming the necessary variables.
Although condition 1 still holds for both models, we observe clear non-normality from the normal
QQ plot, shown in Figure 2. In addition, we notice a clear drop in adjusted R-squared,
multicollinearity issue reappearing, and a decrease in the number of significant predictors. By
looking at Table A3, the estimated coefficients also change greatly during the validation process.
These characteristics suggest that we are unable to validate our model.

If we must pick a final model, then the 4-predictor model is clearly performing better since it
yielded a higher adjusted R-squared, more significant predictors and less multicollinearity.

# Discussion
## Interpretation
The final model consists of four predictors, representing the commute time for As a passenger in
car with 3 or more people, public transit, Bicycle, and Motorcycle, scooter, or moped. The result
in the validation model suggests that, by holding everything else constant, an additional 30 minutes
of commuting by biking will lead to an average death rate decrease of 3.1%, and a 1.1% decrease
in the training model. This may relate to the hypothesis that people are choosing healthier ways of
commuting, which is also safer. However, the other coefficients are not coherent, showing
contradictory information between the two data sets, such as one suggests a positive influence and
the other suggests a positive.
![figure3](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1gGZuwlKdk8zL8lgya53o3GR8jEPojqw6)
Figure 3 highlights the influential points, which considering the sample size of only 100 and 52
respectively, there are many influential points that may affect the entire regression line (Cook’s
Distance), fitted values (DFFITS), estimated coefficients (DFBETAS). Therefore, an observation
that makes a predictor significant in the training data set may be missing in the testing data set,
which makes it difficult to verify the model.
## Limitation
As mentioned, we failed to validate the model due to various reasons. This might be because the
152 large cities differ in nature, and it is difficult to generalize the relationship across different
cities. Hence, it also suggests that there are other factors that affect a city’s death rate, which this
paper failed to consider. Therefore, it leads to inaccurate coefficients in the final model.

By splitting the original data into training and testing data sets, we have sacrificed the sample size
used to fit our models. Such that sample sizes of 100 and 52 are difficult to correctly identify the
underlying relationships between death rate and commute time, a vague connection.
