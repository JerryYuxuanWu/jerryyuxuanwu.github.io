# Introduction
## Background
On June 14, 2017, a fire broke out from a kitchen on the fourth floor of the 23 story tower, Grenfell tower,
killing 72 people (BBC News). Reports have shown a clear pattern that there were more victims living on
higher floors compared to residents living on the tenth floor or below who have all managed to escape or were
evacuated in time (BBC News). The cause of the fire is mainly suspected to be the “addition of external
cladding”, where the polyethylene material catalyzed the fire’s spread (BBC News). In fact, this new cladding,
and other factors that caused the fire, were installed during the renovation processes for this building, which
was built in the 1970s (BBC News). In the aftermath of the disaster, campaign group Architects for Social
Housing (ASH) stated that “the Grenfell fire is not a tragedy but a man-made disaster that could and should
have been avoided”, and architecture critic Douglas Murphy says that “corners being cut is inherent to
construction” (Gidda, 2017).

This event motivates us to examine the potential safety issues dealing with, firstly, high-rises, and secondly,
old buildings, as they were constructed when regulations are less intense and more refurbishments are
required. Hence, provide insights to help with the apartment selection process, and bring attention to the
issue, potentially provoking changes to regulations.
## Research Topic
This paper will focus the study on the apartment buildings in Toronto, Canada, by using the RentSafeTO
scores. RentSafeTO is a program by the City of Toronto dedicated to ensuring “tenants live in safe, wellmaintained
buildings”, where the organization evaluates apartment buildings under a set of criterion and
give a score out of 100 (City of Toronto). In general, criterion measures the condition of the building from
many aspects (scores from 1-5), such as security, elevator, stairwell, exterior cladding, etc (City of Toronto).
Higher scores mean better conditions. The paper will utilize the RentSafeTO results for apartment buildings
evaluated in 2020, found -88on the Toronto Open Data Portal, Apartment Building Evaluation (City of
Toronto Open Data Portal).

In addition to building age and the number of stories, the data also provides information on the number
of units in the building, the property type, and ward, where a ward partitions the city of Toronto into 25
smaller areas by geographic locations (City of Toronto). The research will also leverage these data to provide
more accurate analysis, with additional details discussed later.

By utilizing the RentSafeTO standard as the measure of safety for an apartment building, the research
question for this study is: “**How is an apartment building’s safety affected by factors such as
building age, number of stories, number of units, property type, and ward?**”
## Tools
To answer the above question, we will use a statistical method of linear regression. In short, it helps us to
model and predict the relationship between a dependent variable and many independent variables. In this
scenario, it means that we are trying to model the relationship between RentSafeTO score and building
age/stories/units/type/ward. The model also enables us to judge if there is a relationship or not, if so, how
much? To make this judgment on relationship, hypothesis tests will be performed, which is basically testing
for statistical significance, i.e. if the data shows evidence. More details will be discussed in the method
section.
## Hypothesis
Intuitively, it is reasonable to think that older buildings are less safe because of the aging in materials and
such. Aging buildings can have many structural issues, such as concrete decay, inefficient HVAC (Heat,
ventilation, and air conditioning) systems, electrical issues, and many more (Dansig). These are all safety
hazards that may lead to deadly disasters if left undealt with, or refurbishment below standard, such as the
Grenfell disaster. Hence, it is hypothesized that older buildings have a lower RentSafeTO score than newer
buildings on average.

For the number of stories and units, it is intuitive to think that newer buildings should have more stories,
which leads to more units (this will be illustrated with a graph in the data summary section). Therefore, the
effect of age and unit should coincide in sign with the age of the building. This may seem contradictory to
the fact that more people died from the upper floors in the Grenfell fire, but since the data includes stories
and units, we can assume that RentSafeTO has accounted for stories and units when giving out the scores.

Finally, there are three property types in this context, social housing, Toronto Community Housing (TCHC),
and private housing (City of Toronto). They differ in the type of contractor and operator, corresponding
to the Canadian government, Toronto City Council, and private companies in this case (Government of
Ontario). The three types also have different purposes and target residents, with social housing targeting
low-income groups, TCHC targeting low to moderate-income groups, and private targeting everyone in general
(Government of Ontario) (City of Toronto). Due to the difference in resident income, it also affects the rent
and funding accordingly. It is intuitive to hypothesize that since higher income means more rent and funding
for the building, these apartment buildings undergo better maintenance, which leads to a higher RentSafeTO
score. However, on the other hand, depending on the owner, funding may be different and inspection may be
taken at different levels, so the relationship here is really difficult to predict.
## Structure
The paper will first introduce the data by how it is collected and provide exploratory analysis to showcase
the data. Then the method section will explain the methodology to how we choose the best model using
linear regression, and how we test if there are significant relationships. The results section will provide the
end results obtained through the proposed methodology. Lastly, the paper will end with a conclusion that
summarizes the study and mentions the weaknesses and possible future research.

# Data
## Data Collection Process
Data used for this research is provided by the city of Toronto, published on the city of Toronto open data
portal, named “Apartment Building Evaluation” (City of Toronto Open Data Portal). It is published directly
by the Municipal Licensing & Standards department that conducted the evaluations, where the results are
accessible on the portal. The data set is updated daily since more evaluations are recorded as time progresses.

The data found on the portal has several drawbacks and potential issues. Firstly, the daily update mechanism
is an issue to keep the results of this study reproducible, such that as more data are added every day, the
results will be different. Secondly, this data records the results of all RentSafeTO scores since the program
was established in 2017 and is still updating, and each apartment undergoes at least one evaluation in three
years (City of Toronto). Since the frequency of evaluation depends on the score, buildings with lower scores
are more likely to occur in the data set multiple times than buildings with higher scores. This will violate the
assumption for our linear regression model that requires uncorrelated errors, in other words, the buildings
sampled (evaluated) should be chosen at random (STA302).

The method to cope with these two limitations is to set a time interval on our sample. Since the RentSafeTO
program was established in 2017 and the most frequent evaluation is after one year, we will set our sample
population to the apartment buildings evaluated for the year 2017. By only considering buildings evaluated
for 2017, it makes sure that new data will not affect our sample, making it more reproducible. In addition, it
is reasonable to assume that since this is the first year, every building that is registered is required to be
evaluated, so our data would also be more representative of the population of all Toronto apartment buildings.

Talking about registered, it is by law that apartment buildings must be registered for the RentSafeTO
program, but there could still be buildings failing to do so, and those buildings may be in poor conditions.
In addition, RentSafeTO only evaluates rental apartment buildings in Toronto, which further restricts our
sample’s ability to represent the population of apartment buildings. This will be discussed further in the
conclusion.
## Data Cleaning
Data can either be directly loaded into the programming software used for analysis or downloaded as a local
file. After retrieving the data, we have to perform a few simple steps to clean the data.

1. As mentioned above, we will focus on the sample population of apartment buildings evaluated in
2017, so we will first remove the rows (observations) that records the results for years other than
2017. Note that there are two similar but different variables, “YEAR_EVALUATED” and “EVALUATION_
COMPLETED_ON”, where the former represents the year that the result is for, while the
latter represents the date that the evaluation took place. It is common that the evaluation took place
in the following year, such as some evaluations for the year 2017 were actually taken place in 2018. In
this study, the variable of interest is “YEAR_EVALUATED” because it guarantees that buildings will
only be evaluated at most once each year.
2. Then, it is optional to keep only the interested variables in our data set, along with the “RSN”, which
is a unique ID for each building, stands for RentSafe Number (City of Toronto Open Data Portal). In
the case of this paper, we will keep this ID, the score of the test (out of 100), year built, confirmed
stories, confirmed units, property type, and ward name.
3. For the numeric variables, make sure that they are converted and stored as numeric values in the data
set, rather than words. This will be important when we fit our linear model. Variables include the
score, year built, stories and units.
4. Then, remove the buildings that have appeared twice in the data set by checking for duplicate ID, since
appearing twice does not make sense, and is probably a mistake in the data set. It is difficult to only
keep one of the results because we have no clue which one is the actual result.
5. Finally, we need to remove any observation with missing values for any of the variables because, in
order to perform linear regression, we need a complete observation for every input. Note that if you
did not modify the data set to only include the interested variables, then you only want to remove the
observations with missing values for the interested variables because other missing values will not affect
the result.
## Data Summary
During the cleaning process, it is found that there are 3419 results recorded for the year 2017, but 11
entries are either duplicates or contain missing values for the interested variables. After removing the invalid
observations, the final data set has 3408 eligible results ready for analysis. To get us ready to explore the
data, let’s first recap the important variables that will be studied in this study:

- Year built (numeric): This represents the year that the apartment building was built.
- Confirmed stories (numeric): This represents the number of stories for the building. Shortened to
stories in future use.
- Confirmed units (numeric): This represents the number of units in the building. Shortened to units in
- Property type (categorical): This indicates the type of the apartment building, social housing, TCHC
(Toronto community housing), or Private.
- Ward name (categorical): This indicates the ward that the building is located. There are 25 wards in
Toronto (City of Toronto).
First, the most interested variable in this study is the age of the building, which we are using the year built
variable to measure. We will explore this using a plot that models the relationship between the year built
and the score of the building:
![figure1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1TXBrlty0i-t80MfwGnOZCtzps1uSuA6K)
By looking at the X-axis, it infers the general trend in the ages of our buildings. As most buildings are built 
between the 1950 to 1980 time frame, an incredibly crowded area, it shows that there are 3 very old buildings
that were built before 1850. Meanwhile, there are generally fewer observations outside the 1950-1980 interval,
and many years have zero observations. For these years, it means that we do not have any observations to
help up model the relationship, but rather use the existing data to predict. This will definitely affect the
accuracy of our model to correctly model the relationship. For the blue line, it represents the average score
for buildings built at a given year, and for years without observations, it predicts the outcome based on
nearby observations (ggplot2). In general, the blue line shows a positive trend between the two variables,
which implies that newer buildings are on average getting higher scores than older buildings, something that
was expected.
Then, we will also look at the relationship between RentSafeTO scores and the number of stories and units:
![figure2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1RoJGkspjvEUgVCnl4ukiPyg3YrqYARZ2)
From the two plots, we see similar trends on the left side, that is for lower stories and lower units, we have
more data compared to higher values. At the same time, both variables have a noticeable positive influence
on RentSafeTO scores at lower values. A possible explanation in this synchronization is that the two variables
are highly correlated, such that apartments with fewer stories also have fewer units, and the trend carries
over. However, the positive relationship quickly vanished and flattened out for the middle section, inferring
that the variables are actually unrelated to the scores. On the right side, the number of stories is shown to
have a positive influence on score once again, but the number of units actually showed a negative influence.
The trend shown on the right side can be a result of the lack of observations, where we can see that the
widened gray area indicates that there is very little evidence to support the relationship.

The following table provides a short description of the three types of properties in the data:
![table1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=10jxZQfwy_c_2xwCGqCXJb0C7ltH-517i)
Table 1 shows that most of the apartment buildings are privately owned, with only some being social housing
or TCHC. Meanwhile, it is shown that private housing has lower average scores compared to the other two
types, and it is surprising to find that social housing has an outstanding higher average compared to the other
two categories. However, this may be due to a smaller number of social housing and the existence of outliers.

Lastly, we will quickly look at how the wards behave by only taking 10 out of the 25 wards.
![table2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1z1gBXBzTGo_fZZS8DTihq5suklxTDV4g)
There are clear differences in the sizes of wards, some are very large and some are extremely small. Compared
to the 65.51 average score across all buildings, some wards have much higher averages, such as Scarborough
North, which also only has 8 buildings, and some have slightly lower averages. In general, the variation in the
average scores is significantly large, but some wards at both extremes may have an impact on the score.

All analysis for this report was programmed using R version 4.1.1. Data is loaded using the opendatatoronto
package. In this section, the tidyverse package is used for data transformation (dplyr), data tidying (tidyr),
and plotting the figures (ggplot2). The gridExtra and grid packages are used to format the figures and add
additional labels. The kable function along with the kableExtra package is used to make the tables.
# Methods
This section explains the methodologies used in the study, including the linear regression model, hypothesis
test, assumptions, and the model selection method.
## Linear Regression Model
As mentioned in the introduction, a linear regression model is a statistical method that models the distribution
of a response variable based on predictor variables, written in the form:
![linearreg](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1fHefb82_p45RTCYfKwIZDrmlBURFo9wC)
We will dissect the equation into pieces:
- The yi represents the response variable that we are trying to predict based on the values of the x
predictor variables. In this study, yi = RentSafeTOScoreofabuilding
- There are k number of predictor variables, xi. These are the variables that will be used to predict the
building’s RentSafeTO scores. In the study, we will look at 5 predictor variables, year built, number of
stories, number of units, property type, and ward. However, in the end, we may have more than 5 xi’s
because property type and ward are categorical variables, and in order to fit them into this model, we
will need to use dummy variables that represent the building’s type or ward (ECO375). For example,
we may have x4 = 1 if the building is privately owned, and 0 otherwise.
- There are k + 1 number of β’s because of the additional intercept term, β0. For β0, it represents
the situation when all predictor variables are equal to zero and provides an estimation for the score
(ECO302). However, the interpretation would be invalid if it does not make sense for the predictor
variables to be zero, for example, if we use the number of stories as a predictor, then it is impossible
to make a prediction for a building with 0 floors (ECO302). For the remaining β’s, which are the
coefficients for the predictor variables, they represent the ceteris paribus effect that its predictor variable
has on the response variable y (ECO375). In other words, it means that by holding everything else
constant (other predictor values), a one-unit increase for the i-th predictor, such as an additional floor,
will lead to a βi change in the RentSafeTO score, in our study. However, a non-zero βi value does not
necessarily mean that there is a relationship, such that we would still need to use the hypothesis test to
determine if there is statistical significance.
- The ϵi term, in the end, represents the error term, which allows the individual response to have some
deviations from the expected value. The model assumes that the error terms at given combinations of
predictor values are on average zero, and they have the same variance (spread) across different predictor
values (STA302). In addition, the model also assumes that the errors are uncorrelated with each other,
and are normally distributed (STA302).
- The i subscript represents the individual outcome, such as in our study, it represents each of the 3408
results that we have.

Since we are fitting the model using a set of observations, it means that only the β values are random, and
the response and predictor variables are actually constant as appeared in the data set (STA302).

The model shown above represents the true population, but as discussed earlier, our sample does not fully
represent the population and we have to provide estimates for the β values. We denote the estimated β’s as
ˆβ. In addition, this paper will use the frequentist approach, which assumes that the average RentSafeTO
scores given any combination of predictor variables are fixed.

Ultimately, the goal is to use the data set to estimate the β values and find the predictor variables that best
predict the RentSafeTO scores. To do so, the method of OLS, ordinary least squares, will be used. The OLS
method provides estimators for the β values by minimizing the sum of squared error, ϵi (ECO375). In other
words, it finds ˆβ values that model the line which minimizes the deviation between the estimated scores
(on the line) and the observed scores (in the data set). Think of this as finding the equation of the best-fit
straight line.

## Hypothesis Test
To examine the statistical significance for the predictor variables, which is to see if the data shows evidence
against something, we will perform hypothesis tests on the estimated ˆβ values. The test is set up with two
hypotheses, given as
![hypothesis](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1xm9d27pZHYlApa2S8qLdSgCu2sJcr08E)
The null hypothesis H0 states the claim that the coefficient for the i-th predictor is 0 in the true model,
suggesting that there is no relationship between the response variable and this predictor variable, while the
alternative hypothesis HA claims that this coefficient is not 0, and there is a relationship (ECO375). In the
context of this study, an example is to test whether the year built is related to RentSafeTO score in the true
model, and we will use our estimated ˆβ for the year built variable to test this claim.
The methodology for the hypothesis test is to find the probability of observing a value that is as extreme or
more than the ˆβ we see, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Under a 5% significance level,
we will reject the null hypothesis if this probability, denoted as the p-value, is lower than 0.05.
The steps of calculating the p-value are outlined below (ECO375):

1. Use the results from linear regression model to find the test statistic, given as
![t-stat](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=130ft4fJYQgCku3IpZEPtZZH1vT2vIg-A)
, where βi,0 is the value from the null hypothesis, which is 0 in this case.
2. Then, find the probability of witnessing a value as extreme or more as the test statistic under the null
hypothesis, giving the p-value to be:
![pvalue](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1wGAb6e6Q8GNflOv4Qh3_tvjjpJ1XXlt7)
3. If p < 0.05, it means that there is enough evidence against the null hypothesis and we can reject the
null hypothesis. In this context, it means that there is no relationship between this predictor variable
and the RentSafeTO score.
This is the general approach for a hypothesis test. Since the values will be computed automatically by
software when fitting the linear model, this part did not go in-depth.

## Assumptions
For the linear regression model to provide unbiased ˆ β values, there are a number of assumptions that need to
be followed in the data (STA302). As discussed earlier, the assumptions mostly rely on the behavior of the
error term, ϵi, requiring it to have zero-conditional mean, uncorrelated between each other, and common
variance (STA302). If any one of these assumptions is violated, then the ˆ βi will be biased, meaning it will
not be accurate depictions of the true β value (STA302). We will briefly discuss them one by one:

1. Zero-conditional mean in errors means that for the errors in estimations, it is expected that they are
actually random, rather than related to the score (STA302). In other words, we have included all the
variables that impact the RentSafeTO score in our model. This assumption is very difficult to prove
perfect due to its strictness.
2. Uncorrelated errors mean that the error of one observation is not correlated to the error of another
observation. Since we have considered this in the data section, this assumption should hold.
3. Common variance refers to the error term having the same spread at different values of predictor
variables. In other words, the error terms should deviate evenly at all combinations of our predictor
variables. By looking at Figures 1-3, we see that the vertical spread of the dots are not constant, where
some places are wider than others, implying a potential violation of this assumption.

Although not all assumptions are satisfied fully, we can still perform linear regression, but just keep in mind
that the ˆβi may be biased.

An assumption for the linear regression model that is used for the hypothesis test is the normality of errors
(STA302). This assumption enables us to determine the distribution of the coefficients, which is used to
construct the hypothesis test. So along with the zero-conditional mean and common variance, the error terms
also need to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and common variance. Since we cannot fully show the
zero-conditional mean and common variance assumptions, this assumption will also likely to fail. However, in
order to make some inferences from our data, we will assume that this assumption can hold, even weakly.

## Model Selection
The last preparation is to choose a technique when picking which predictors will be used. Although we have
five predictor variables, not all of them may be related to the RentSafeTO score. Similar to the minimizing
sum of squared errors technique used in the least square estimate, we will choose the model that maximizes
the adjusted R-squared.

In other words, the adjusted R-squared measures the model’s ability to explain the variance in the response
variable by using the number of predictors, given as (ECO375):
![adjr2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1sVdGR9Sq7A2zk4r6XYgz1pbb379MtEki)
Here, k is the number of predictors and n is the number of observations. SSreg represents the amount of
variance explained by the model, and SST represents the total number of variance present in the model
(ECO375).

Generally, the adjusted R-squared takes values from 0, no fit, to 1, perfect fit, and is a great tool to measure
the fit of a model, while penalizing for the number of predictors. For this study, we will calculate the adjusted
R-squared for all the possible combinations of the five variables and choose the model that has the highest
value.

# Results
## General Result
After we have used all the possible combinations of variables to fit linear regression using the OLS method,
the model that yields the highest adjusted R-squared includes the variables: year built, confirmed stories,
property type, and ward. The absence of the number of units variable indicates that adding it to the model
is simply not worth it. The return for this extra predictor is not sufficient. In Appendix A.1, the adjusted
R-squared for all combinations considered during the model selection process is shown.

For these four variables, property type and ward are categorical variables, which means that the model uses
dummy variables to represent the building’s type and ward. Although there are 3 property types and 25
wards, there will be only 26 dummy predictor variables to avoid perfect multicollinearity, where one property
type is dropped and one ward is dropped (ECO375). An easy way to think about this is to consider the case
if we include three property types and an intercept, then naturally the intercept represents the case when the
building is not one of these three types, but this does not make sense (ECO375). By leaving one type out,
then we can say that the intercept represents the average score for the building of the left out type.

The full result from linear regression is shown in Appendix A.2. The results show that for the variables
other than ward, the p-value are all lower than 0.05, which means that in the hypothesis test there is enough
evidence against the null hypothesis, and we get to reject the claim that the corresponding predictor is not
related to the score. In other words, it is statistically significant that these predictors are related to the
RentSafeTO score. Therefore, we can then interpret the estimated ˆ β coefficients and relate them to the
practical significance.

For simplicity, we will include only 5 wards that influence scores the most and are statistically significant
with a p-value less than 0.05 from the hypothesis test. First, the simplified equation can be modeled as (the
full model will include 19 more dummy variables to indicate the ward):

In this model, we have the estimated intercept βˆ0, two numeric predictor variables with estimated coefficients
βˆ1, βˆ2, and 7 dummy variables for the selected categorical variables, which as a recap, equals to one of the
building is in this category and 0 otherwise, and they have coefficients β3ˆ−9. Lastly, our estimated model will
also have some errors.

Note that as mentioned in the Method section, the results can be biased, such that the estimated coefficients
may not be accurately equal to the true coefficient in the actual model. To interpret the results, we will
assume that they are unbiased and represents the population.
![result](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1mR3BYvdw3glTvsEjBKlciKhmrZak4E2z)
The estimated coefficients are shown below in Table 3:
![table3](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1mNcA_mVSEeHI9jifwprJ0oxKPaMPkiJW)

The adjusted R-squared for the full model is given by: R2adj = 0.1896. This means that by adjusting for the
number of predictors used, which is 28 (1 age, 1 story, 2 property type, 24 wards), the estimated model is
able to explain roughly 18.9596% of the variations in the RentSafeTO scores. This is clearly far from 1, but
it is the best that we can get from these predictor variables.

We will take a closer look at each variable one by one.

1. **Intercept**: The estimated intercept is -164.38, but it does not yield meaningful interpretations because it
simply does not make sense to have a score for a building that’s built-in year 0, with 0 floors, and
does not belong to the 2 property types and 24 wards (in the model).
2. **Year Built (Age)**: The estimated coefficient for the year built predictor is 0.12, which implies that by holding other
variables constant, when the year built increases by one year, i.e. the building is one year newer,
then the building will on average score 0.12 marks higher. In another perspective, for buildings
with the same traits across variables other than the year built, a building that is 10 years newer
is expected to score 1.2 marks higher than the building that is 10 years older. The positive sign
indicates a positive relationship, such that as the year built increases, which means the building is
built more recently, then it will on average score higher. Oppositely, as building ages, years built
decrease, then the average score will decrease. This corresponds to our hypothesis and provides
evidence for the claim that older buildings tend to be less safe, as shown by the RentSafeTO score.
3. **Number of Stories**: The estimated coefficient for the number of stories estimator is 0.08, which implies that by holding
other variables constant, when the building is one story taller, then it will on average score 0.08
points higher. This also coincides with our hypothesis, such that this variable is actually correlated
to the age of the building, so it will inherit the positive relationship from the year built. However,
by comparing 0.08 to 0.12, it is found that the ceteris paribus effect of the number of stories is
less than the year built. This means that the building’s age affects its safety score more than the
number of stories.
4. **Property Type**: As R performs the OLS estimation method, it chose to leave out the private type to avoid perfect
multicollinearity, leaving social housing and TCHC. This means that the coefficients for social
housing and TCHC are actually with respect to the private type (ECO375). By examining the
estimated coefficients for these two categories, it is found that W.R.T the private type and holding
the other variables constant, then if the building is of type social housing, then the average score
will increase by 2.05, and if it is TCHC, then the average score will decrease by -1.91. This indicates
a positive influence of social housing on the score and a negative influence of TCHC on the score.
The result follows what we observed in the data summary section, where it is shown that social
housing has a higher average score in general. Comparing this to the private apartments, then it
means that social housing has a higher average score and TCHC has lower.
5. **Ward**: Ward is a categorical variable similar to the property type. The left-out ward is Beaches-East
York, so others are relevant to this ward. In the simplified model, we have looked at 5 wards that
have the largest impact, with values as low as -6.69 and as high as 5.54. These are quite large
values compared to the estimated coefficients above, which implies that the location of the building
actually plays quite a large role in the scores.
## Specific Case
We will interpret the estimated model even further by considering a specific case: What is the estimated
relationship between RentSafeTO score and the year built for buildings that are 3 stories tall, is privately
owned, and are located in the Etobicoke Center ward? By plugging in the necessary values, we get:
![case](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&scale.option=fit&id=1VGwFDT7Olx-djhoLv3S2rlv2my-Y6SUj)
If we graph it onto the Figure 1, we get:

By looking at this figure, it seems that although the blue dots are scattered around the blue line, the line
seems to be the best fit for these 11 buildings. The blue line is generally on the low side of all the observed
buildings, which is reasonable because the buildings only have three floors, do not benefit from higher floors,
and are located in Etobicoke Center, which has a large negative effect on score compared to other wards.

The technique of choosing a special case, like the one we have here, is useful because it allows us to treat
the other variables as control variables (ECO375). It allows us to make inferences regarding buildings with
similar traits, by specifying the number of stories, the type, and the location. The linear model is useful
because it allows us to find such an equation for any combinations of the controlled, predictor, variables. This
ultimately improves the accuracy of our estimations when we have more information about the building’s
traits.

All analysis for this report was programmed using R version 4.1.1. The ols_step_all_possble() function
in the olrss package was used to select the model. Then the lm() function in base R was used to derive the
estimates of a frequentist regression in this section. The tidyr and dplyr packages were used to create and
manipulate dataframes and tibbles. Broom package is used, especially the tidy() function, to store the
linear regression results. The ggplot package was used again to plot Figure 3.

# Conclusions
In this paper, motivated by the Grenfell tower fire, the purpose is to explore the relationship between an
apartment building’s safety and its traits such as the age and number of floors. The paper leveraged the
data from RentSafeTO, a program that measures the safety of apartment buildings in Toronto. In the
hypothesis, we predicted that newer buildings will have higher average scores, and since the number of
stories/units is positively correlated to the year built, they should also have higher average scores. We were
generally uncertain about the effect of property type on the score. To find the relationship, we utilized the
linear regression model to estimate the RentSafeTO safety score based on the predictor variables. With
the five initial predictor variables in hand, we performed linear regression using the OLS method for every
combination of these variables and picked the model with the highest adjusted R-squared, which is the model
that explains the variations in the score most effectively with its number of predictors. The resulting model
includes the predictor variables: year built, number of stories, property type, and ward, which does not
include the number of units because its ability to improve the model is minimal. Then, hypothesis tests were
performed on the estimated coefficients, which shows a statistically significant relationship between all the
predictor variables except a few wards.

The results have shown that the year built and the number of stories of an apartment building have positive
effects on the RentSafeTO score. This coincides with the hypothesis, such that newer buildings with a higher
number of stories score on average higher points. It is shown that by holding the number of stories, property
type, and ward constant, buildings that are 10 years newer score on average 1.18 points higher. Results
also suggested that by compared to private buildings, social housing that are operated by the government
have higher average scores, and TCHC buildings that are operated by the City of Toronto have lower scores.
This could be a result due to more government funding for social housing and political strategies. Lastly, by
comparing to the Beaches-East York ward, it is shown that some wards have much different average scores,
where the location can affect the average score by up to a -6.69 change.

## Weaknesses
The paper is not rigorous in proving the assumptions for linear regression, where violations in multiple
assumptions may exist. These violations will cause the estimated coefficients to be biased, and unable to
represent the true coefficient. On the other hand, the paper is also limited by the data. Although the goal is
to look at the population of all apartment buildings worldwide, the data set can only represent the sample
population of apartment buildings in Toronto, which is a metropolitan city with an enormous amount of
buildings, and some very old buildings. As cities across the world may have different regulations, economies,
geographical traits, it is difficult to generalize the result from this study to all cities in the world (STA302).

## Next Steps
In the future, studies on this topic should try to overcome the weaknesses mentioned above. This is to take
more time with the assumptions, utilize more statistical tools to explore the data, and perhaps improve the
data set by incorporating more predictor variables. In addition, it is also recommended if the data can provide
safety measurements for an apartment building in other places. Then it is also possible to compare the safety
by controlling the type of city. In addition, more time could be spent on potentially adding interaction terms
for the predictor variables, or manipulating them through non-linear transformations, which might improve
the model.

## Discussion
In conclusion, it is shown that the RentSafeTO score that measures the apartment building’s safety is related
to many factors. By identifying the relationships between buildings with low scores, authorities can tackle
the problem with more information. for example, they may want to pay extra attention to the old buildings,
or buildings located in areas that have much lower average scores.
